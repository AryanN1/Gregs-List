# Thinkful Bootcamp Checkpoint: Greg's-List 

You are building a search results page as represented in the designs found below this list of requirements. For the prototype you'll demo to your team, you'll provide results to a user search for software jobs.

Reasonable but not pixel perfect implementation of the designs provided below.
For each result item, use the same element structure and classes. In other words, you should only have to write style rules once for a search result item, and then use the same class on each individual search item. Feel free to repeat the text between search items, but try to get titles of different lengths so you can see how it impacts your layout.
The design calls for a magnifying glass icon. Use this image file (whose URL you can copy by right-clicking and selecting "Copy Image Address") (Image not inserted)

Include a page title (aka, use a <title> element) and meta description in the head.

Put the <input> and the element with the magnifying glass in a common <form> element.

Don't waste your time looking at how Craiglist (your competitor!) coded up their site, as it doesn't follow best practices.
